  - Select (or create) a workspace folder.
    - (Close the "Welcome" window if it os open
  - New -> Project ... Java ... Java Project

    - choose "Copy files and folders" (here and elsewhere) if it gives you
      a choice
  - Drag the asst4Starter/lib folder onto the 'asst4' icon in the package
    explorer
  - Drag the test file, TypeErrors.java onto the 'asst4' icon in the packae

  - Set up the lib file by:
    - click on the 'asst4' icon in the package explorer.
    - Project -> Properties
    - Java Build Path
    - Libraries tab
    - Add Class Folder ...
    - click on the check-box that corresponds to lib under the asst4 project
    - OK
    - OK
  - Set up the WrangLR JAR file by:
    - click on the 'asst4' icon in the package explorer.
    - Project -> Properties
    - Java Build Path
    - Libraries tab
    - Add JARs ...
    - open up 'asst4', then 'jars' in the pop-up window
    - click on wrangLRv0_8.jar (or whatever the JAR file name is) in the
      pop-up window
    - OK
    - OK
    
You now should be ready to edit your Sem4Visitor.java and Sem5Visitor.java
files in the visitor package.

You can run using main/Main4 as the main class. If you want to see the AST
appear in a window, you should include the -w switch in the command-line
arguments along with the name of the MiniJava source file. (Use Run->
RunConfigurations...) When you run for the first time, you will see a lot
of "???" annotations, indicating expressions whose type fields are null, and
therefore need to be filled in.
